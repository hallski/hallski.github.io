After much consideration I came to the conclusion that I wanted to move my blog back to it's original location at [http://micke.hallendal.net/](http://micke.hallendal.net). All the posts were migrated even though they were mostly outdated but I decided to keep them around this time. I left the comments behind though as most of the discussions weren't relevant anymore anyway.

While migrated I decided to switch back to pure [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) after running with [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for a year or so. The reason was that everytime I wanted to update the blog I had to relearn what how to do it and possibly also update Octopress. I've found it easier to remember how to update the blog with Jekyll.

So, here's to hoping for more regular posts in the future... (never heard that one before!)

**Update** Decided to register hallski.org instead and moved the blog there.
