Personal blog about development, architecture and other code related topics. I have a strong interest in learning new languages and explore various aspects of programming. Currently I'm working primarily in Javascript on Google Cloud Platform but have in the past worked 8 years as an iOS developer and prior to that about 10 years of GNOME/Linux development.
